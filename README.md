## Deploying ML Model using Flask
This project is a Flask web application that allows users to predict salaries using a deployed Machine Learning model based on regression. The model takes input features such as experience, education, and other relevant factors, and provides a salary prediction based on the regression analysis.

TechStack - numpy, pandas, Flask , Sklearn and  Regression

The project aims to demonstrate the complete process of developing a Machine Learning model, deploying it using Flask, and creating a user-friendly web interface for salary predictions.
